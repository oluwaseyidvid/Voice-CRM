// Minimal build placeholders - real Gradle files must be the proper project layout when building.
// This flat package is meant for upload convenience; CI will expect a standard Android project structure.
// Keep these here as metadata for your review before moving files into a real project structure.
// Do not attempt to build directly from the flat folder on local machine.
